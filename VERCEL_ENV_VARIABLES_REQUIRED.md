# URGENT: Add These Environment Variables to Vercel

## Your build is successful! âœ… 
The Vercel build completed perfectly - the issue is missing environment variables.

## Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
- Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Select your `meducism-portal` project
- Click on "Settings" tab
- Click on "Environment Variables"

### 2. Add These Required Variables

**Add each of these as a new environment variable:**

| Variable Name | Value | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Set environment to production |
| `REPL_ID` | `[Your Replit Project ID]` | Get from your Replit project |
| `REPLIT_DOMAINS` | `meducism-portal.vercel.app` | Your Vercel domain |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | `[Generate 32+ char string]` | Any secure random string |
| `ISSUER_URL` | `https://replit.com/oidc` | Replit auth endpoint |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `[Your PostgreSQL URL]` | From Neon/Supabase/etc |

### 3. How to Get Missing Values:

**For REPL_ID:**
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Check the URL or environment variables
3. It looks like: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-k1l2m3n4o5p6`

**For SESSION_SECRET:**
Generate any random 32+ character string, like:
`my-super-secure-session-secret-2025-vercel-deploy`

**For DATABASE_URL:**
1. Sign up for free at neon.tech
2. Create a new PostgreSQL database
3. Copy the connection string (starts with `postgresql://`)

### 4. Set Environment for All Stages
- Make sure to check "Production", "Preview", AND "Development"
- This ensures the variables work in all environments

### 5. Redeploy
After adding all variables:
- Go to "Deployments" tab
- Click the three dots on latest deployment
- Click "Redeploy"

## Why This Fixes It
Your build is perfect, but the server crashes at runtime because it can't find required environment variables. Once you add them, the app will work immediately.

## Expected Result
After adding variables and redeploying, you should see the beautiful Meducism platform UI with the healthcare-themed design instead of raw code.
