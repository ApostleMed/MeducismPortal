# VERCEL RUNTIME ERROR FIXED

## Issue Identified:
The error "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" was caused by the `functions` configuration in `vercel.json`.

## Solution Applied:
- Removed the `functions` configuration block
- Vercel will automatically detect the Node.js runtime for files in `/api`
- Simplified configuration to use only `rewrites`
- Maintained proper routing to the serverless function

## Current Configuration:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/app"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/app"
    }
  ],
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public"
}
```

## Status:
- Build verified working locally
- Configuration simplified and corrected
- Ready for redeployment

The deployment should now succeed without runtime errors.
