# Migrating Meducism Platform to Vercel

## Current Status
âœ… Live at: https://meducism.replit.app
ðŸŽ¯ Target: meducism.org on Vercel

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Export Code to GitHub
The project needs to be pushed to your GitHub repository (ApostleMed/MeducismPortal).

Since git operations are restricted in this Replit environment, you have two options:

**Option A: Manual Download/Upload**
1. Download this entire project as ZIP from Replit
2. Extract and upload to your GitHub repository
3. Ensure all files are included (especially the fixed vercel.json)

**Option B: Use Replit Git Interface**
1. Go to Tools â†’ Git in Replit
2. Commit all changes: "Premium Meducism platform ready for Vercel"
3. Push to origin: https://github.com/ApostleMed/MeducismPortal.git

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to vercel.com and sign in
2. Import project from GitHub: ApostleMed/MeducismPortal
3. Vercel will auto-detect the configuration from vercel.json
4. Deploy (should work immediately with current config)

### Step 3: Connect Custom Domain
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to project settings
2. Add custom domain: meducism.org
3. Vercel will provide DNS records (A and CNAME)
4. Update these in your Namecheap DNS settings
5. Wait for propagation (usually 10-30 minutes)

## Files Ready for Vercel

âœ… vercel.json - Configured for static React app
âœ… package.json - Build scripts ready
âœ… dist/ folder - Generated after build
âœ… All React components with royal blue design
âœ… Fixed HTML validation issues
âœ… Professional README.md

## Vercel Configuration Details

The vercel.json is configured to:
- Use @vercel/static-build
- Serve React app from dist/ folder
- Route all requests to index.html (SPA routing)
- Handle static assets correctly

## Domain DNS Setup
When you get to Step 3, Vercel will likely provide:
- A record: pointing to Vercel's IP
- CNAME record: pointing to your-project.vercel.app

Update these in Namecheap's DNS management for meducism.org.
