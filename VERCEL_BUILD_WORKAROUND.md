# VERCEL BUILD COMPATIBILITY FIX

## Problem:
- Vercel is using an older Node.js version despite `.nvmrc`
- `vite` command not found in PATH
- Only 523/632 packages installing

## Solution Applied:

### 1. Created Custom Build Script (`build.js`)
- Uses `npx vite build` instead of `vite build` directly
- `npx` ensures the command is found even if not in PATH
- Handles both frontend and backend build steps
- Provides better error reporting

### 2. Updated Vercel Configuration
- Changed `buildCommand` to use custom script: `node build.js`
- This bypasses the PATH issues with direct command execution

### 3. Build Process Now:
1. Custom script checks Node.js version
2. Installs dependencies if needed
3. Uses `npx vite build` (always works)
4. Uses `npx esbuild` for server build
5. Provides detailed logging

## Why This Will Work:
- `npx` resolves command location automatically
- Custom script provides better error handling
- Works regardless of Node.js version PATH issues
- Maintains all existing functionality

## Next Steps:
1. Commit these changes to GitHub
2. Redeploy in Vercel
3. The build should succeed with proper command resolution

This approach works around Vercel's Node.js version/PATH limitations while maintaining full functionality.
