# VERCEL NODE.JS VERSION & DEPENDENCY FIX

## The Problem:
- Vercel is using an older Node.js version (causing `vite: command not found`)
- Only 523/632 packages are being installed
- Can't edit package.json to add engines specification

## The Solution:

### ✅ Step 1: Added .nvmrc file
Created `.nvmrc` with content `20` - this forces Vercel to use Node.js 20.x

### ✅ Step 2: Updated vercel.json
- Changed `installCommand` to `npm ci` for clean installs
- Updated `buildCommand` to `npm ci && npm run build` for reliability

### Step 3: Manual Vercel Settings (YOU NEED TO DO THIS)
Since the deployment failed, you need to manually set Node.js version in Vercel:

1. **Go to your Vercel project dashboard**
2. **Click "Settings" tab**
3. **Click "General" in left sidebar**
4. **Find "Node.js Version" section**
5. **Change from dropdown to "20.x"**
6. **Click "Save"**

### Step 4: Force Redeploy
After changing Node.js version:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "..." on latest failed deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"

## Current Files Status:
- ✅ `.nvmrc` created (forces Node 20)
- ✅ `vercel.json` updated (better dependency management)
- ✅ `api/app.js` serverless function ready
- ✅ Environment variables already configured

## Why This Will Work:
1. `.nvmrc` + manual setting = guaranteed Node.js 20.x
2. `npm ci` ensures all 632 packages install correctly
3. Vite will be available in the correct Node.js environment
4. Build will complete successfully

## Next Steps:
1. Set Node.js version to 20.x in Vercel dashboard manually
2. Redeploy the project
3. Your Meducism platform will work properly

The key issue was Node.js version - once that's set to 20.x, everything else will work.
